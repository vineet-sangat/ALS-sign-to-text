# ASL Sign Language Recognition 🧏‍♂🤟

A deep learning project to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) hand gestures and convert them into text using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

## 🚀 Demo

Upload or draw an ASL hand sign and the model will predict the corresponding letter.  
👉 (Optional: Add Gradio link here if deployed)

---

## 📌 Features

- 🧠 Built with *Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)*
- 🖐 Recognizes *American Sign Language (A-Z except J)*
- 📊 Achieved over *99% training accuracy* and *91%+ validation accuracy*
- ⚡ *Real-time prediction interface* using *Gradio*

---

## 📂 Dataset

- [Sign Language MNIST Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist)  
The dataset contains grayscale images (28x28) of ASL hand gestures with corresponding labels.
